## 💬 Motivation

I'm building my AI & DS foundation — one line of code at a time.  
This repo is not just practice — it's my *proof of progress.*

I don't just want to learn Python.  
I want to **master** it, monetize it, and build empires with it. 👑

This is just the beginning. Watch me build it all —  
📚 The skills,  
💼 The career,  
🧠 The brand,  
✨ The life.
